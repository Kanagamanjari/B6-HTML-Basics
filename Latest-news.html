    <u><h3>Kentucky flood survivors say there was no time to escape the deluge</h3></u>
    <p>
        As the floodwaters receded, tales of survival emerged Tuesday from victims who were roused from their sleep by alerts and quickly found themselves trapped 
        in their homes by floating furniture blocking the doors. They described the experience as surreal, recalling how they had to ford through waist-deep water 
        to reach loved ones only to be turned back by the swift current or watch as trucks and uprooted trailers were swept away. Many said everything they owned 
        was either taken or destroyed by the deluge.

        <u><h4>Extraordinary rain, historic floods</h4></u>
        <p>The worst flooding happened Wednesday night into Thursday morning, the result of a historic storm in eastern Kentucky that occurred while most people 
            were sleeping and that inundated the hollers so quickly it cut off most escape routes.

            Dustin Jordan, the National Weather Service’s science and operations officer in Kentucky, said that before the storm his agency 
            "issued numerous flash flood warnings and also upgraded them all the way up to catastrophic, which is pretty much the highest level you can go, 
            which is basically like a flash flood emergency."

            Some areas saw 14 to 16 inches of rain over a five-day period last week, he said.

            Whitaker said he and his wife thought they were goners, too, when their house suddenly started filling up with water.

            “There was enough water to float everything in the room," he said. "Everything was floating around until the water receded. The refrigerator 
            was upside down. Two of the beds were floating so hard against the ceiling that they were tearing the ceiling up.”

<u><h3>Americans are piling up credit card debt as they struggle to keep up with the high cost of living</h3></u>

        Americans are piling up credit card debt as they struggle to keep up with the high cost of living.
    </p>
    <p>
        US household debt surpassed $16 trillion for the first time ever during the second quarter, the New York Federal Reserve said Tuesday.
        Even as borrowing costs surge, the NY Fed said credit card balances increased by $46 billion last quarter.
    </p>
    <p>Over the past year, credit card debt has jumped by $100 billion, or 13%, the biggest percentage increase in more than 20 years. Credit cards
       typically charge high interest rates when balances aren't fully paid off, making this an expensive form of debt.
